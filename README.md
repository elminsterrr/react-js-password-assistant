# react-js-password-assistant

You can see it live here: [Heroku](https://react-js-password-assistant.herokuapp.com/)


## Features

I created it for some banks websites where while logging they ask you to give the first letter of your password, then, for example, fourth, then seventh etc.
I was tired of counting this by myself so I've created a password assistant.

This app does not send anything outside and all calculations are made inside your browser.
